      At ApcreationWorld, we strive to provide high-quality products and
      services. However, if you are not entirely satisfied with your purchase,
      we’re here to help. Below is our Return and Refund Policy, which outlines
      the steps and conditions for returning products and requesting a refund.
    </p>
    <h4 className="mt-4">Returns</h4>
    <p style={{ fontSize: 20 }}>
      You have 7 days to return an item from the date you received it. To be
      eligible for a return, your item must be unused and in the same condition
      that you received it. The item must also be in the original packaging.
    </p>
    <h4 className="mt-4">Conditions for Return:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li style={{ fontSize: 20, color: "black" }}>
        Product must have proof of purchase (receipt or order confirmation).
      </li>
      <li style={{ fontSize: 20, color: "black" }}>
        The item must be in its original condition, including packaging,
        manuals, and any accessories.
      </li>
      <li style={{ fontSize: 20, color: "black" }}>
        Products that have been opened or used will not be eligible for return
        unless defective.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h4 className="mt-4">Non-returnable items include:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li style={{ fontSize: 20, color: "black" }}>Clearance items</li>
      <li style={{ fontSize: 20, color: "black" }}>

    </ul>
    <h4 className="mt-4">Refunds</h4>
    <p style={{ fontSize: 20 }}>
      Once we receive your returned item, we will inspect it and notify you of
      the status of your refund. If your return is approved, we will initiate a
      refund to your original payment method.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li style={{ fontSize: 20, color: "black" }}>
        Refunds may take up to 7-10 business days to reflect in your account,
        depending on your card issuer’s policies.
      </li>
      <li style={{ fontSize: 20, color: "black" }}>
        Shipping costs are non-refundable unless the return is due to a mistake
        on our part (e.g., wrong or defective item).
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h4 className="mt-4">Exchanges</h4>
    <p style={{ fontSize: 20 }}>
      We only replace items if they are defective or damaged. If you need to
      exchange an item, send us an email at info@smartprinterworld.com, and we
      will guide you through the process.

    <p style={{ fontSize: 20 }}>
      You will be responsible for paying for your own shipping costs for
      returning your item unless the item is defective or an error occurred
      during shipping. We recommend using a trackable shipping service or
      purchasing shipping insurance. We cannot guarantee that we will receive
      your returned item.
